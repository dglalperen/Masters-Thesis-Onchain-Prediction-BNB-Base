#### Title:
*Evaluating the Cost Efficiency of Blockchain-Based Insurance Predictions Compared to Traditional Insurance Companies: A Case Study of BNB Chain and Base Blockchain*

#### 1. Introduction:
In recent years, blockchain technology has gained traction in various industries, offering decentralized, transparent, and secure platforms for executing transactions and processes. One of the potential applications of blockchain is in the insurance industry, where predictive models are used to assess risk, calculate premiums, and process claims. However, traditional insurance companies rely heavily on centralized infrastructures, which can be costly and time-consuming.

This thesis aims to explore the feasibility and cost-efficiency of deploying pretrained neural network models for insurance predictions on blockchain platforms. Specifically, we will compare two blockchain solutions—BNB Chain and Base Blockchain—with the conventional methods used by insurance companies for processing insurance claims and predictions.

The central hypothesis is that blockchain-based insurance predictions can offer more cost-efficient, scalable, and secure alternatives to traditional approaches, without compromising prediction accuracy.

#### 2. Problem Statement:
Traditional insurance companies spend significant resources on IT infrastructure, personnel, and operational costs to manage predictive models and process claims. These centralized processes may introduce inefficiencies, higher costs, and slower processing times. Blockchain technology, on the other hand, promises decentralized computation, reduced transaction costs, and automated smart contracts, which may lead to more efficient claim predictions.

The key question addressed in this thesis is: Can blockchain platforms such as BNB Chain and Base Blockchain offer more cost-efficient methods for making insurance predictions compared to traditional insurance companies?

#### 3. Objectives:
- Primary Objective: To evaluate the cost-efficiency of deploying pretrained neural network models for insurance claim predictions on blockchain platforms (BNB Chain and Base Blockchain).
- Secondary Objective: To compare the gas fees and transaction costs on these blockchain platforms with the operational costs incurred by traditional insurance companies for similar predictive tasks.

#### 4. Research Questions:
1. How much gas is consumed for processing insurance predictions on BNB Chain and Base Blockchain?
2. What is the cost of blockchain transactions compared to the operational costs (IT infrastructure, personnel, etc.) of traditional insurance companies?
3. Can blockchain platforms provide the same or better performance (accuracy, speed, and scalability) in making insurance predictions?
4. What are the trade-offs between blockchain-based and traditional insurance prediction methods in terms of security, transparency, and decentralization?

#### 5. Methodology:
The methodology for this thesis involves the following steps:

1. Blockchain Selection: The blockchain platforms chosen for this study are BNB Chain and Base Blockchain. These platforms are selected for their cost efficiency, scalability, and established infrastructure for decentralized applications.

2. Model Deployment: Pretrained PyTorch neural network models will be deployed as smart contracts on both blockchains. These models will be trained on insurance datasets to predict claim risk and severity. The same models will be run in a traditional infrastructure to compare costs.

3. Cost Comparison:
   - Blockchain Cost Analysis: Gas fees for processing predictions on BNB Chain and Base Blockchain will be measured and recorded.
   - Traditional Cost Analysis: Estimations of operational costs (including personnel, cloud computing, IT infrastructure, and software tools) for traditional insurance companies will be collected using publicly available data and academic reports.

4. Performance Evaluation: The accuracy, speed, and scalability of predictions on blockchain platforms will be compared to those of traditional systems. Metrics like mean squared error (MSE) for prediction accuracy and transaction completion times will be recorded.

5. Scalability and Security Analysis: Blockchain’s ability to scale predictions to larger datasets and its security features will be analyzed and compared to traditional centralized insurance infrastructures.

### Evaluation Strategy

The evaluation of this thesis will focus on two primary dimensions: cost efficiency and prediction accuracy. The aim is to compare the performance of insurance prediction models deployed on blockchain platforms (BNB Chain and Base Blockchain) against the original pretrained PyTorch models in terms of cost-effectiveness and accuracy retention. The following methods and metrics will be used to evaluate the models:

---

#### 1. Cost Efficiency Evaluation

The goal is to measure and compare the cost per prediction on blockchain platforms versus the estimated operational costs of traditional insurance companies for making similar predictions. This will include analyzing gas fees on the blockchain as well as calculating the infrastructure and personnel costs associated with traditional systems.

##### a. Gas Fees and Transaction Costs (Blockchain)
- For each prediction processed on both BNB Chain and Base Blockchain, the gas fees incurred by running the smart contracts will be recorded.
- Gas usage will be measured in units of gas, and the corresponding transaction costs will be calculated by multiplying the gas used by the prevailing gas price in the network (in BNB for BNB Chain and ETH for Base Blockchain).

##### b. Operational Costs (Traditional Insurance)
- Estimated operational costs for traditional insurance companies will be calculated using publicly available data and research reports. These costs include:
  - Cloud infrastructure costs: The costs incurred by traditional insurance companies for using cloud services such as AWS, Google Cloud, or Microsoft Azure for running machine learning models.
  - Personnel costs: Estimated salaries for the data scientists, actuaries, and IT staff responsible for building and maintaining the predictive models.
  - Software costs: Costs related to licenses for using predictive analytics software (e.g., SAS, SPSS), or cloud-based machine learning tools like AWS Sagemaker.

##### c. Cost Comparison Formula
To quantify the cost efficiency, the Cost Efficiency Ratio will be calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Cost Efficiency Ratio} = \frac{\text{Cost per Prediction (Traditional)}}{\text{Cost per Prediction (Blockchain)}}
\]

Where:
- Cost per Prediction (Traditional) includes the sum of all relevant operational costs for predictions made in centralized systems.
- Cost per Prediction (Blockchain) will be derived from the gas fees and transaction costs on the respective blockchain platforms.

##### d. Statistical Methods for Cost Analysis
- Mean Cost: The mean gas fee per prediction will be calculated for multiple blockchain transactions to obtain an average cost per prediction on each blockchain platform.
- Standard Deviation: The standard deviation of gas fees across different transactions will be calculated to evaluate the variability of costs, considering that gas prices may fluctuate due to network congestion.
- Hypothesis Testing: A t-test or Wilcoxon signed-rank test will be employed to statistically evaluate whether the cost differences between blockchain transactions and traditional operational costs are significant.

##### Success Criteria:
- If the Cost Efficiency Ratio shows that blockchain-based predictions are significantly cheaper than traditional insurance company systems, this would support the hypothesis that blockchain is a more cost-effective solution for insurance predictions.

#### 2. Prediction Accuracy Evaluation

The second key dimension of evaluation is ensuring that the accuracy of predictions from the blockchain-deployed smart contracts closely matches the accuracy of the original pretrained PyTorch models. The focus here is to evaluate whether blockchain deployment introduces any significant loss in prediction accuracy.

##### a. Accuracy Comparison between PyTorch and Smart Contract Predictions
The prediction accuracy of the models deployed on the blockchain (BNB Chain and Base Blockchain) will be compared with the pretrained PyTorch models to evaluate if accuracy is retained post-deployment.

- Accuracy (%): For both the PyTorch models and the blockchain-based smart contracts, the accuracy will be calculated as the percentage of correctly predicted outcomes from the total number of predictions. The formula is:

\[
\text{Accuracy} = \frac{\text{Number of Correct Predictions}}{\text{Total Predictions}} \times 100
\]

- Accuracy Loss (%): To assess the impact of blockchain deployment on model performance, the accuracy loss will be computed as:

\[
\text{Accuracy Loss} = \frac{\text{Accuracy (PyTorch)} - \text{Accuracy (Blockchain)}}{\text{Accuracy (PyTorch)}} \times 100
\]

A high accuracy loss (e.g., >5%) would indicate that the blockchain model suffers from performance degradation compared to the original model.

##### b. Mean Squared Error (MSE) for Continuous Output Models
For models predicting continuous outputs (e.g., insurance claim amounts), Mean Squared Error (MSE) will be used to measure the difference between predictions from the PyTorch models and the blockchain-based smart contracts. The MSE formula is:

\[
\text{MSE} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2
\]

Where:
  - \( y_i \) is the actual output from the PyTorch model.
  - \( \hat{y}_i \) is the predicted output from the blockchain-based model.
  - \( n \) is the total number of predictions.

A low MSE indicates that the blockchain-based model is closely aligned with the original PyTorch model.

##### c. Statistical Methods for Accuracy Analysis
- Paired t-test or Wilcoxon signed-rank test: A paired t-test or Wilcoxon signed-rank test will be performed to evaluate the statistical significance of differences between the PyTorch and blockchain model predictions. This will determine if the accuracy difference between the two implementations is significant.
- Threshold for Accuracy Loss: A predefined threshold of 5% accuracy loss will be set. Any accuracy loss greater than this threshold will be considered unacceptable, indicating that blockchain deployment has a significant negative effect on prediction quality.

##### d. Cross-Validation
Both the Py

Torch models and blockchain-deployed models will undergo k-fold cross-validation. Cross-validation ensures that the results are generalizable and not specific to a particular subset of the data.

- K-fold cross-validation involves splitting the data into k subsets, using k-1 subsets for training and 1 subset for testing. The process is repeated k times, and the average accuracy is calculated.

##### Success Criteria:
- The accuracy loss between the PyTorch and blockchain models should be less than 5% to ensure that blockchain deployment does not significantly degrade prediction quality.
- If the accuracy and MSE show no significant differences between the two implementations, the blockchain models will be considered sufficiently accurate.
