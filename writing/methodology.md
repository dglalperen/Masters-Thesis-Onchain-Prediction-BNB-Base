Key Components of the Thesis:
Objective: To demonstrate that deploying insurance prediction models on blockchain platforms like BNB and Base is more cost-efficient than the processes used by traditional insurance companies.

Research Questions:

How do blockchain transaction costs (e.g., gas fees on BNB and Base) compare to the operational costs of traditional insurance companies when processing predictions or claims?
Can blockchain provide the same or better performance (in terms of accuracy, scalability, and cost-efficiency) for calculating insurance claim predictions compared to conventional methods?
What are the trade-offs in terms of security, transparency, and speed between using blockchain and traditional methods for insurance processes?
Methodology:

Deploy the same pretrained PyTorch insurance prediction model on both BNB Chain and Base Blockchain.
Conduct comparative testing by calculating predictions (e.g., claims risk scores) for real-world datasets on the blockchain.
Measure and compare the gas fees incurred by each blockchain during the prediction process.
Simulate the costs insurance companies typically incur for claim predictions (e.g., IT infrastructure, labor, and operational overhead).
Perform a cost-benefit analysis to determine the cost-efficiency of blockchain over traditional insurance processes.
Evaluation Metrics:

Cost Analysis: Compare the gas fees and operational costs on BNB and Base with the typical transaction costs in insurance companies.
Performance Metrics: Assess the accuracy and speed of the predictions on both blockchains.
Scalability: Evaluate how well each blockchain can handle large datasets, focusing on the cost and performance of processing high volumes of predictions.
Challenges:

Potential limitations of blockchain platforms (e.g., transaction throughput limits, finality times).
Possible regulatory or legal challenges in implementing blockchain-based insurance prediction systems.
Expected Outcome:
BNB Chain is likely to provide the most cost-effective solution, with very low transaction fees, making it ideal for real-time insurance claim predictions.
Base Blockchain may offer additional security benefits, making it suitable for more regulated environments like insurance, while still maintaining lower costs compared to Ethereum or traditional systems.
