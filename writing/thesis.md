Thesis Title:
Evaluating the Cost Efficiency of Blockchain-Based Insurance Predictions Compared to Traditional Insurance Companies: A Case Study of BNB Chain and Base Blockchain

Thesis Statement:
This thesis explores the cost efficiency of deploying pretrained neural network models for insurance claim predictions on blockchain platforms, specifically BNB Chain and Base Blockchain, in comparison to traditional insurance company infrastructures. The hypothesis is that blockchain technology offers a more cost-efficient, scalable, and secure alternative to conventional centralized insurance processing systems.
